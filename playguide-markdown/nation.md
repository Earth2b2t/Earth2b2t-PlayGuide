# How to Create a Nation
Create the strongest nation and unify the world.

#### Decide the name of your nation 

The name of the nation can be decided by the player who created the nation, and the name will be displayed on the [**world map**](/guide/dynmap) and [**war**](/guide/war). There are no limit on names, so create your own original nation. You will be charged to change the name of your nation, so please decide carefully.

#### Founding a Nation

You can found a nation by main menu or using ```/n new <name of country>``` in the chat box. You will need ```1000SC``` to found a country. If you don't have enough, you can collect SC by [**Daily Quest**](/guide/dailyquest) etc.

#### Nexus

When a nation is created, a luminous endstone is generated in the center of the chunk where the nation was founded. This endstone is the nexus. It cannot be destroyed. The nexus is used as the nucleus of the nation when [**war**](/guide/war) is conducted.

#### Protection of territory

After a nation is established, its territory is protected. Nationals within a nation's territory are immune from attack by players who do not belong to that nation. It also prevents other players who do not belong to the state from setting up or destroying blocks in the territory.

#### Teleportation to a Nation

If you are a member of a nation, you can teleport to the nation by spending [**SC**](/guide/currency). Teleportation is initiated by doing ```/n spawn``` in the chat box. Each time you use it, you will spend ```1000SC```, so please use it systematically. Also, you must remain still for a few seconds after the teleportation.
