# Protect and sell architecture
Protect the architecture in your country and protect it from other citizens. Sell your protected buildings and earn [**SC**](/guide/currency) and become a millionaire.

#### Protecting Architecture

Players who belong to a nation can protect the architecture of their nation. To do so, left-click or right-click on the desired area with the wooden stick and select [**main menu**](/*guide/menu) or ```/n protect claim``` to complete the protection. Since it costs ``4SC`` per block to protect, if you don't have enough SC, you can use [**daily quest**](/guide/dailyquest), [**adventure chest**](/guide/adventurechest), [**chest store **](/guide/chestshop) to collect [**SC**](/guide/currency). Once protected, it prevents other citizens from destroying and installing blocks. The protected land can be restored by executing ```/n protect purge```. The [**SC**](/guide/currency) consumed in that case will not be returned.


#### Selling Architecture

Protected buildings can be sold from the land by selecting [**Main Menu**](/guide/menu) or ```/n protect sell <amount>```. When the sold land is purchased, the player who sold the building will receive the specified amount of [**SC**](/guide/currency) immediately. You can end the sale with ```/n protect deport```.


#### Buying Buildings

You can purchase buildings for sale by paying the specified amount of [**SC**](/guide/currency). Purchases can be made by using ``/n protect buy`` from within an architecture. To maintain the purchase of a building, it must be renewed every two months and the ``/n protect continue`` must be executed within that time period from within the building. Each renewal will cost a certain amount of [**SC**](/guide/currency). Also, when you purchase a building, you can teleport to the country where the building is located by paying ``1000SC``. Teleportation is available from the [**main menu**](/guide/menu). Please note that you will not be refunded if your purchased buildings are stolen by [**war**](/guide/war) or any other reason. Please purchase safe buildings.
