# Develop a Nation
Develop your nation and unite the world with your country. The functions described here are mainly for kings and ministers.

#### Adding More Citizens

To add more citizens to a nation, you need to send an invitation to the player to join your nation. Invitations can be sent using ```/n invite <mcid>``. If the invitation is accepted, the player becomes a citizen. Conversely, you can kick a citizen from a country with ```/n kick <mcid>``. Let's build a strong nation with many citizens!

#### Setting up roles

There are three types of positions in a nation: King, Minister, and Citizen. The player who founded the nation becomes the king, and the player who joined the nation becomes a citizen. Only the king and ministers can manage the nation. The king can promote a citizen to the rank of minister by ```/n promote <mcid>``. Conversely, a ```/n demote <mcid>`` to a minister will demote him to citizen. Also, a ```/n promote <mcid>``` by the king to a minister can transfer the king.

#### How to increase your territory
 
To increase a nation's territory,　use [**Main menu**](/guide/menu) or the king or minister must make a ```/n claim`` on land adjacent to the nation.
When performed, ``100 NC`` will be consumed from the NC credited to the state. If you do not have enough NCs for your nation, you can collect NCs by [**Daily quest**](/guide/dailyquest) or [**Adventure chest**](/guide/adventurechest) to deposit them, or encourage your people to deposit their NCs.
Conversely, perform ```/n disclaim`` on an acquired territory will return to the wilderness and the NC consumed will be returned to the nation.

※The territory of the state is indicated by a border as shown in the image. It changes to orange when viewed from the outside.

#### How to make alliances

You can apply for an alliance between nations with ```/n ally invite <nation ID>``. If the other nation approves the application, it becomes an alliance. Once an alliance is formed, each nation's citizens are protected within each other's nation. However, when an ally loses a war, it must bear 10% of the reparations. Also, allies cannot engage in [**war**](/guide/war) with each other. Alliances can be broken by ```/n ally remove <nation ID>``.

#### リChanging the respawn position

The respawn position of a nation is the initial respawn point in [**WAR**](/guide/war). It also serves as the teleportation point for the nation. The nation's respawn location is initially the [**nexus**](/guide/nation) location. It can be changed to any location from the [**main menu**](/guide/menu).
